# Team Profile Generator
## Description    
The following project is an application built in Node.js that takes in information about employees of a software engineering team. When the input has been gathered, the HTML content will be created and a webpage displaying a summary of these employees will be shown. The goal of the project was to not only provide a shippable application, but also expand my understanding of Object Oriented Programming.
